# Cargo Location Game

## Project Overview
This Python project is a simple, interactive command-line game where players guess the locations of hidden cargo. The cargo is randomly placed in different locations, and players must find the correct spots to win.

## How to Run
To play the game, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Download the `cargo_game.py` file from this repository.
3. Open a command-line interface and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded file.
4. Run the script with the command `python cargo_game.py`.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Game Rules
- The cargo is hidden at three random locations between 1 and 7 kilometers.
- Players have to guess the locations by entering kilometer marks.
- The game informs the player if all the cargo is found or if they need to guess again.
- If not all cargo is found, the locations are re-randomized, and the player can guess again.
